# Cruise â€“ Docker TUI Client

> Terminal UI for managing Docker with style and speed.

**Cruise** is a powerful, intuitive, and fully-featured TUI (Terminal User Interface) for interacting with Docker. Built with Go and [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), it offers a visually rich, keyboard-first experience for managing containers, images, volumes, networks, logs and more â€” all from your terminal.


## Description

Ever felt that docker CLI is too lengthy or limited? Find yourself executing commands again and again for stats? Or wrote a full multiline command just for a typo to ruin it? Well... Fret no more. Cruise - Is a TUI Docker Client, fitting easily in your terminal-first dev workflow, while making repetitive Docker work easy and fun.

> How is _cruise_ different from existing solutions?

Existing applications are limited in what they do, they serve as mostly a monitoring service, _not_ a management service let alone a Client.

With Cruise you can:
- Manage Lifecycles of Containers, Images, Volumes, Networks.
- Have a centralized Monitoring service
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Get Detailed view on Docker Artifacts
- and more to come!
