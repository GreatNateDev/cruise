# About

Cruise is a powerful, intuitive, and fully-featured TUI (Terminal User Interface) for interacting with Docker. Built with Go and Bubbletea. 
It offers a visually rich, keyboard-first experience for managing containers, images, volumes, networks, logs and more â€” all from your terminal.

## Why not Docker CLI?

> Ever found yourself writing commands again and again for stats? or wrote a long command just for a typo to mess it up?

Cruise solves this problem, now you can interact with docker from your terminal, from common lifecycle management to complex 
Vulnerability scanning. 

Cruise seemlessly fits into your terminal-first dev workflow, be that on a remote server or a physical machine. Making working with docker easier
and more fun.

## Why not other TUI Alternatives?

Other TUI Alternatives such as lazydocker or docui (deprecated) are more of a _monitoring_ service than a _management_ application.

Cruise on the other hand, aims to be a Docker TUI Client, allowing management _and_ monitoring of most docker services. With cruise
you can have the benefits of a TUI app without having to deal with the downsides of the Docker CLI. It blends both of them perfectly
obtaining the best of both worlds.

Oh, and did I mention? Cruise looks a lot better... _and is also configurable_.
